# Machine Learning Bootcamp Projects
 Projects I developed while doing the Machine Learning Bootcamp on Udemy.

The SVM algorithm loads the data directly from a library. The other algorithms require that you have the data stored locally. I have shared the data in this repository as well. Feel free to download the data and algorithms to test them out yourself.
